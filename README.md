## Required work

1. Please add your name and GitHub username to the list below. (Due to student privacy laws, I can't actually require you to post your name in a public repository. If you have privacy concerns, you can email me for an alternate way to complete the assignment.)

2. Edit the file `names.py` to define a function which returns your name WITHOUT using any string literals that contain any letters of your name, then add your function to the list `NAME_FUNCTIONS`, so that when the program runs, it prints the names of everyone who completed the assignment. I provided an example to get you started. I did it in a somewhat overly-mathematical way, but you're welcome to do it in a simpler way. The point of this assignment is to make sure everyone can use GitHub, not to test your math skills.

Note: Since I don't have your GitHub usernames yet, I can't add you as collaborators, so you won't be able to edit my files. You can make your own fork and submit a pull request. After that, I can add you as a collaborator so you can make further changes without waiting for my approval, if you want.

This assignment is due by the end of the day on Friday, September 5.

## GitHub Usernames

Add yourself to the list below. (Please keep the list alphabetized by last name.)

## Sandbox

Optionally, you may edit the below area if you want. For example, you can use this area to experiment with Git/GitHub, or discuss potential project ideas with your classmates.
